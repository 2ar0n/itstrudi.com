        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">MISSION</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">I created Trudi because I wanted to use natural and locally made cosmetics as much as possible while drastically reducing my plastic consumption at the same time!</p>
        <p class="text-lg">As a woman suffering from the Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), I’ve been increasingly aware of all the nasty things most cosmetics contain that disrupt our hormones (Download the app <a href="https://incibeauty.com/" class="font-bold underline">INCI Beauty</a> to scan your cosmetics if you're curious!) ! Several studies estimated that Human Fertility could reach zero by 2045 because of all these hormonal disruptors we consume on a daily basis… (sounded a little bit too much like a terrifying black mirror episode to me!) </p>
        <p class="text-lg"> By creating my soaps, I wanted to regain control over the things I put in my body and as well as the impact I have on the planet. My motto is "No Nasties!":  No polluting or unnatural products and no endocrine disruptors!</p>

    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-blue-400 rounded-2xl text-white p-8 text-center mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">I use local products (from Switzerland or Europe) as much as possible to limit the carbon footprint of shippin. I only use products that are soft on the skin, like olive oil, shea butter and natural clay. And avoid anything unatural or polluting like palm oil or artificial coloring!</p>
        <p class="text-lg">Only essential oils are used in the soap (no alcohol-based fragrances): not only do they make the soap smell incrediblyyy trudilicious,  they also have amazing aromatherapeutic benefits! </p>
        <p class="text-lg">On average, 40gr of Essential Oil and 1kg of natural oils are used per batch of soap.</p>

    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-300 to-green-400 rounded-2xl text-white p-8 text-center mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">PROCESS</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">Trudi soaps are made using the cold process method: an environmental-friendly process dating back to 2’8000 BC!  By incorporating the ingredients at room temperature, all the benefits and properties of the oils are preserved.</p>
        <p class="text-lg">All my soaps are minimum 5% superfat to make them extra soft and perfect for dry and sensitive skin. They can all be used for hands and body, and depending on the essential oils for face and hair too!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400 rounded-2xl text-white p-8 text-center mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">ETHICS</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">All the soaps are locally handcrafted in Geneva, Switzerland with vegan ingredients. No animal cruelty or super long supply chain!</p>
        <p class="text-lg">The goal is to have natural soap with high quality ingredients made as accessible and affordable as possible to everyone! No indecent margin in the pricing or exploitation of workers.</p>

        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">SHIPPING</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">I decided to only ship my soaps locally (in Switzerland and neighboring regions) and not ship internationally as it would defeat the purpose of being local. There are many talented soapmakers around the world that I am confident there will be one near you!</p>
        <p class="text-lg">As for packaging, I am reusing cardboard boxes and paper to avoid unnecessary waste. The envelopes I used are made from recycled material and the plastic bubbles can easily be detached for easy recycling. I still haven’t found the perfect plastic-free enveloppes however, and willing to hear all your suggestions to reach hopefully a 100% zero-waste business!
