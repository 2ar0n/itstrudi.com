        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">Mission</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">I created Trudi because I wanted to use natural and locally made cosmetics as much as possible while drastically reducing my plastic consumption too!</p>
        <p class="text-lg">As a woman suffering from the Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), I’ve been increasingly aware of all the nasty things most cosmetics have in their ingredient list that further disrupt my hormones (download the app <a href="https://incibeauty.com/" class="font-bold underline">INCI Beauty</a> to scan your cosmetic products too!) ! Several studies estimated that Human Fertility could reach zero by 2045 because of these hormonal disruptors…</p>
        <p class="text-lg">Time to act! By creating my soaps, I wanted to regain control over the things I put in my body and as well as the impact I have on the planet. My motto is "No Nasties!":  No polluting or unnatural products and no endocrine disruptors!</p>

    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-blue-400 rounded-2xl text-white p-8 text-center mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">Ingredients</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">I use local products (from Switzerland or Europe) as much as possible to limit the carbon footprint of shipping, and only use products that are good for the skin, like olive oil, shea butter and natural clay. (No palm oil or artificial coloring!)</p>
        <p class="text-lg">Only essential oils are used in the soap (no alcohol-based fragrances). Not only do they make the soap smell delicious, but they also have amazing aromatherapeutic benefits! </p>
        <p class="text-lg">On average, 40gr of Essential Oil and 1kg of natural oils are used per batch of soap.</p>

        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">Process</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">Trudi soaps are made through the cold process method, an environmental-friendly process dating back to 2’8000 BC!  By incorporating the ingredients at room temperature, it preserves all their benefits and properties.</p>
        <p class="text-lg">All my soaps are minimum 5% superfat to make them extra soft and perfect for dry and sensitive skin. They can all be used for hands and body, and depending on the essential oils for face and hair too!</p>

    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400 rounded-2xl text-white p-8 text-center mt-5">
        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">Ethics</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">All the soaps are locally handcrafted in Geneva, Switzerland with vegan ingredients. No animal cruelty or super long supply chain!</p>
        <p class="text-lg">The goal is to have natural soap with high quality ingredients made as accessible as possible to everyone! No indecent margin in the pricing or exploitation of workers.</p>

        <h1 class="text-3xl mb-3">Shipping</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">I decided to only ship my soap locally (In Switzerland and neighboring regions) and not ship internationally as it would defeat the purpose of being local… There are many talented soapmakers around the world that I am confident there will be one near you!</p>
        <p class="text-lg">As for packaging, I am reusing cardboard boxes and paper to avoid unnecessary waste. The envelopes I used are made from recycled material and the plastic bubbles can easily be detached for easy recycling. I still haven’t found the perfect plastic-free enveloppes so let me know if you have ideas by sending an email here: <a href="mailto:trudisoap@gmail.com" class="text-bold underline">trudisoap@gmail.com</a>!</p>
